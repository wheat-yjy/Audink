Audink is an audiobook gnenerating product based on A.I. We noticed that current speech systhesis is stiffly and without changes of speed and pit. Thus We want to optimize the result of machine speech synthesis. We will analyze text uploaded by users and generate an audiobook with rich dramatic doom in voice. Our implementation includes text classification, speech synthesis and speech enhancement.
